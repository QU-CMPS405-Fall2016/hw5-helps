If you are passing other test cases, but struggling with tests 6-10, you might have a bug related to your integers overflowing.  
Try this set of inputs with your program and see what happens...

```
10000
100
10
10
555
```

Note: This is not the testcase being used for grading, but it should show you
the integer overflow problem.
